Undo a 'stick' operation
Can only be used while sticking is valid

Algorithms:
When a player sticks:
  their status is changed from rolling to sticky
  the current roll is shown in their roll record
  their new total is calculated by adding the current roll to their previous total
  their new total is displayed

If a player tries to unstick
  if their status is not sticky then no action is taken
  else 
  their status is changed from sticky to rolling
  the current roll is removed from their roll record 
  their current total is recalculated by summing their roll record
  this total is displayed

When a  roll ends:
  the current roll is added to the roll record of players still rolling 
  all current totals are replaced by their new total
  all players have their status changed to stuck
