Unstick

Undo a 'stick' operation
Can only be used while player status is sticky

Algorithms:
When a player tries to stick:
  if their status is not rolling then no action is taken
  if the dice status is rolling then no action is taken
  else 
  player status is changed from rolling to sticky
  the current roll is shown in the current entry of their roll record
  their new total is calculated
  their new total is displayed
  a countdown timer is started for triggering changing their status to stuck

If a player tries to unstick
  if their status is not sticky then no action is taken
  else 
  the countdown timer is cancelled
  their status is changed from sticky to rolling
  the current entry of their roll record is erased
  their current total is recalculated
  this total is displayed

When a run ends:
  the current roll is added to the roll record of players still rolling 
  all current totals are replaced by their new total
  all players have their status changed to stuck

When a run starts:
  all players have their status changed to rolling
  the die (dice) is (are) rolled 

When a roll starts:
  the die-status is changed to rolling
  any sticky players have their status changed to stuck
  their countdown timers are cancelled

When a roll ends:
  the die-status is changed to showing
